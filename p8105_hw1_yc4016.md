# Problem 1

##### Load `penguins` dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The name of variables are species, island, bill_length_mm,
    bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
    -   Some important value:
        -   The mean of flipper length is 200.92 mm.
        -   The median of flipper length is 197 mm.
        -   The mean of bill length is 43.92 mm.
        -   The median of bill lengthis 44.45 mm.
-   The size of the dataset are 344 rows and 8 columns.
-   The mean of flipper length is 200.92 mm.

##### Make the scatter plot.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 5, width = 5)
```

# Problem 2

##### Create dataframe.

``` r
hw1p2_df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "g", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("level1", "level2", "level3", "level1", "level2", "level1", "level1", "level2", "level3", "level1"))
)
hw1p2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##    vec_norm vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1  -0.361  FALSE       a        level1    
    ##  2   0.726  TRUE        b        level2    
    ##  3  -0.415  FALSE       c        level3    
    ##  4  -0.608  FALSE       d        level1    
    ##  5   0.0335 TRUE        e        level2    
    ##  6   0.901  TRUE        f        level1    
    ##  7   1.50   TRUE        g        level1    
    ##  8  -0.188  FALSE       g        level2    
    ##  9   0.754  TRUE        i        level3    
    ## 10   0.352  TRUE        j        level1

##### Take the mean of each variable.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1p2_df, vec_norm))
```

    ## [1] 0.2693149

``` r
mean(pull(hw1p2_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(hw1p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1p2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1p2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   We can take the mean of numeric variable and logical variable.

-   We cannot take the mean of a character variable and factor variable,
    which has results NA.

-   After converting logical, character, and factor variables into
    numeric variable, we can take the mean of logical and factor
    variables. However, we still cannot take the mean of a character
    variable.

-   The logical variables are stored as a distinct data type that TRUE
    is stored as 1 and FALSE is stored as 0. Factor variables are stored
    as integers. So after converting to the numeric, we can take the
    mean of logical and factor variables. However, character variable
    are stored as character, so we could not take the mean of it. Yes
    this helps explain what happened when you try to take the mean.
