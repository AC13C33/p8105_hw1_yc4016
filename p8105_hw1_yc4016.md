# Problem 1

Load `penguins` dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The name of variables are species, island, bill_length_mm,
    bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
    -   Some important value:
        -   The mean of flipper length is 200.92 mm.
        -   The median of flipper length is 197 mm.
        -   The mean of bill length is 43.92 mm.
        -   The median of bill lengthis 44.45 mm.
-   The size of the dataset are 344 rows and 8 columns.
-   The mean of flipper length is 200.92 mm.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
