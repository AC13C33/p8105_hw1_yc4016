```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

Load `penguins` dataset.

```{r setup_dataset}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

* The name of variables are `r names(penguins)`. 
  * Some important value: 
    * The mean of flipper length is `r round(mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), digit = 2)` mm.
    * The median of flipper length is `r round(median(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), digit = 2)` mm.
    * The mean of bill length is `r round(mean(pull(penguins, bill_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), digit = 2)` mm.
    * The median of bill lengthis `r round(median(pull(penguins, bill_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), digit = 2)` mm.
* The size of the dataset are `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns.
* The mean of flipper length is `r round(mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), digit = 2)` mm.
